# HyperAir
Welcome to HyperAir, Pilot! Navigate multiple planes (current count: 4) through various weather... for an endless amount of time. <br />
impressive, huh? <br />
don't worry, because there's gonna be more!

# Instructions!
1. Install Python 3 if you haven't already. (any version of python3 is alright)
2. Install/update pygame:
    - If already installed, use `pip install pygame --update` or `pip install pygame -U`. (a `python3 -m ` can be added to the start of each one, but don't forget a space in between!)<br />
    - If not installed, use `pip install pygame` or `python3 -m pip install pygame`. <br />
3. Installation
    - Go to the releases page (https://github.com/HyperSourceGithub/hyperair/releases) and download the latest version as a .zip file **(Source Code (zip))**. <br />
    - Open the .zip file, and extract all the files. This is done automatically on Mac, and can be done on Windows by clicking "extract all" in the top bar. If you need help, run a quick google search. <br />
4. Running the game
    - Find this new folder created (not the .zip) and open the `flightsim.py` file. 
5. Play!
